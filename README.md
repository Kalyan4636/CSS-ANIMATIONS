# CSS-ANIMATIONS - 💃 
CSS animation is a technique used to create animated effects on HTML elements. It works by gradually changing the CSS properties of an element over a period of time.

To create a CSS animation, you must first define one or more keyframes. Keyframes are snapshots of the element's CSS properties at specific points in time. For example, you could define a keyframe for the start of the animation, a keyframe for the middle of the animation, and a keyframe for the end of the animation. 😊 + ❤️

Once you have defined your keyframes, you can then apply the animation to an element using the animation property. This property takes the name of the animation as a value.
